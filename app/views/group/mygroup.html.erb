<span class="inline_table">For example, I want to make custom field with car models list. Of course, it would be too weird to cram the entire list in one combobox. The standard way to avoid this is a two combobox with nested lists, in first combo, user choose car brand, second combo loads in background list of models by this brand. Is it possible to create something similar in Redmine for the non Ruby programmer?</span><br/>

The underlying theme here is that you should be versioning <br/>your database DDL (and DML, when needed) and providing change scripts to be <br/>able to update any version of your database to a higher version.
